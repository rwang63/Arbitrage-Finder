def shortest_paths(self, start_vertex, tolerance=0):
    """
    Find the shortest paths (sum of edge weights) from start_vertex to every other vertex.
    Also detect if there are negative cycles and report one of them.
    Edges may be negative.

    For relaxation and cycle detection, we use tolerance. Only relaxations resulting in an improvement
    greater than tolerance are considered. For negative cycle detection, if the sum of weights is
    greater than -tolerance it is not reported as a negative cycle. This is useful when circuits are expected
    to be close to zero.
